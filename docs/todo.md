## R&D Todo
* To determine appropriate sensor:
* * Which particles are most commonly found in smoke from burning organic waste?
* * Which sensors are cost-effective for the purpose of mass distribution?
* Which MCU's should be used for prototyping?
* * Emulators for prototyping / practice?
* * Energy requirements?
* Power requirements
* * Solar cells for small devices?
* Housing details
* * How many chimneys are usually found on collective housing buildings? Is there a chimney/apartment ratio that can be worked out?
* * Is the problem of trash burning also pervalent among people living in houses?
* Contact the government.
* * Which government agencies has an interest in this project?
* * Which government agency has data relevant to the project?
* Obtain publicly available data for use.
* * Who has data? (Norwegian agencies might have tons of info on this stuff)
