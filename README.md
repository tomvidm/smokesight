# Scorched Rubbish
## Introduction
This repository holds the codebase, documentation and specifications for project Scorched Rubbish.

Horrible "spec" doc and a todo list is located in the docs folder. The rest is just bare bones folder structure with CMakeLists.txt to save the monumental effort of later writing nano CMakeLists.txt
